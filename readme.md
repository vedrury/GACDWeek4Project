Files
-----

-   **codebook.md**: describes the variables, data, and any
    transformations or work performed to clean up the data
-   **`run_analysis.R`**: script that performs the following, as
    established by the project rubric:
    1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard
        deviation for each measurement.
    3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the
        data set
    4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable
        names.
    5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy
        data set with the average of each variable for each activity and
        each subject.
-   **finaltidy.txt**: the final tidy dataset resultant from
    objective 5.
